# シャルル の 名刺

My portfolio website.

In designing this portfolio website, I drew inspiration from the Japanese business card, 名刺 (Meishi), renowned for its simplicity, elegance, and pivotal role in professional interactions. I opted for vanilla JavaScript and engineered a site that remains functional without JS and CSS. This approach ensures broad compatibility and rapid load times, with a focus on efficiently and elegantly delivering content. It's a design choice that embraces the business card's philosophy of being simple, direct, and universally accessible, while also demonstrating a commitment to creating user-friendly, accessible web experiences.
