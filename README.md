My portfolio website


## Design choice

tl;dr: Portfolio uses vanilla JS and the main content is still accessible without JS and CSS.

In creating this portfolio website, I drew inspiration from the Japanese business card, 名刺 (Meishi), which is known for its simplicity, elegance, and pivotal role in professional interactions.
I opted for vanilla JavaScript to keep it simple and engineered a site that remains functional without CSS and presentable  without JS. This approach ensures broad compatibility and rapid load times, with a focus on efficiently and elegantly delivering content.
